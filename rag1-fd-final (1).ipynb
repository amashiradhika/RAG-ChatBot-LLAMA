      "Fixed deposits offered by banks and NBCs are all applicable to tax deductions. Different thresholds of deductions on interest earnings are applicable to different age groups.\n",
      "1. TDS on Bank FD\n",
      "Interest income will be taxable if the earnings exceed Rs. 40,000 for citizens aged below 60 and up to Rs. 50,000 for senior citizens. The tax on FD interest is deducted at 10%.\n",
      "2. TDS on non-bank (NBFC) FD\n",
      "For non-bank (NBFC) FD, the threshold limit for tax on FD interest is Rs. 5,000. The interest income will be taxable if the earnings exceed Rs. 5,000 in the case of a company FD. The TDS is deducted at 10%. But if the interest you earn on FD exceeds the amount mentioned above, and you fail to share your PAN details with your bank or NBFC, the TDS to be deducted doubles to 20% of the interest earned.\n",
      "Indian residents pay lesser TDS compared to their NRI counterparts, 10 and 30 per cent respectively. For both cases, you can submit Form 15G or Form 15H at the beginning of the financial year to claim tax exemption on fixed deposit.\n",

      "TDS on FD with an example\n",
      "Fixed Deposits (FDs) are a popular investment option offering guaranteed returns. But the interest earned on FDs is taxable. Here's how TDS on FD works:\n",
      "For regular citizens (below 60 years old), any interest income exceeding Rs. 40,000 per year attracts a 10% TDS. Let's say you have 3 FDs:\n",
      "Bank A (Rs. 50,000 interest), Bank B (Rs. 30,000) and Bank C (Rs. 20,000). Only Bank A's interest surpasses the Rs. 40,000 threshold, so TDS applies only to that amount. Banks B and C's interest will be exempt from TDS.\n",
      "Senior citizens (60 years and above) enjoy a higher exemption limit of Rs. 50,000 under Section 80TTB of the Income Tax Act. This means they can earn more interest on their Fixed Deposit before any TDS is deducted.\n",
      "\n",
      "How TDS on fixed deposit interest is calculated?\n",
      "The total interest income from your fixed deposits in a given financial year must be included to your total income and taxed accordingly if the bank does not deduct TDS from it.\n",
      "Even though it might not be paid out, include the interest income in your overall income on your yearly Income Tax Return (ITR). When filing an ITR, interest income must be disclosed under the heading \"Income from other sources.\" Check which tax bracket you are in.\n",
      "The TDS (which has already been deducted) will be adjusted by the income tax division against your final tax obligation.\n",

      "Premature FD Withdrawal: Interest, Penalty & Charges\n",
      "\n",
      "Fixed deposits have long been a favoured investment avenue, offering a secure and predictable way to grow one's savings. However, circumstances may arise where the need for funds prompts individuals to consider premature withdrawal of their fixed deposits. This financial decision, while providing immediate liquidity, comes with consequences that extend to the interest earned on the deposit. Understanding the implications of premature withdrawal is crucial for investors, as it can impact the overall returns on their investment. In this article, we will understand the dynamics of premature fixed deposit withdrawal and its subsequent effects on interest calculations, shedding light on the considerations and potential drawbacks associated with this financial manoeuvre.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is premature withdrawal\n",
      "Premature Withdrawal is a term used to describe the process of withdrawing money from a fixed deposit account before its maturity date. This can be done in case of an emergency or if you need the money for some other purpose. However, banks and financial institutions may charge a penalty for premature withdrawal, which can reduce the interest rate earned on the deposit.\n",
      "The penalty charges for premature withdrawal of fixed deposits can be levied in different ways. For instance, some banks may charge a percentage of the interest earned as a penalty, while others may charge a fixed amount.\n",
      "It is important to read the terms and conditions of the fixed deposit scheme carefully before investing.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the premature withdrawal of a fixed deposit account?\n",
      "Fixed deposits offer the flexibility of premature withdrawal, allowing you to close the account before its maturity date. Nevertheless, availing this option usually incurs a penalty fee imposed by the bank or financial institute. The purpose behind this penalty is to discourage frequent withdrawals and encourage a savings discipline. It's worth noting that some banks or financial institutes may permit FD withdrawal without imposing any penalty fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "How premature withdrawal of FD affects interest rate\n",
      "Let's assume that you've invested a sum of Rs. 10 lakhs over a tenor of 48 months, with an interest rate of 8.05% This interest rate is set for 48 months. Say you want to withdraw the FD after 12 months. The interest will be calculated at the former rate, which was the interest rate on a one-year FD when you first opened the fixed deposit.\n",
      "So, before you choose premature withdrawal, do the calculation and be prepared to receive lower returns. If not, try to fund emergencies using other modes of finance like personal loans, cash reserves, or the sale of an asset. This way, you can keep your FD intact until the lapse of the tenor.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to calculate penalty on premature withdrawal of fixed deposit?\n",
      "Depending on the lender you have chosen, you may have to pay a significant sum of money as a penalty. This could range from 0.50% to even up to 2% of the FD amount. So, before you prematurely close your FD, ensure that you are prepared to pay this penalty.\n",
      "Choose a lender that makes premature withdrawal easy and has flexible terms. Consider opening a Fixed Deposit with Bajaj Finance, which charges a low premature withdrawal fee while offering an attractive rate of interest on FD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you know?\n",
      "By investing Rs. 3 lakh in Bajaj Finance Digital Fixed Deposit for just 42 months, you can earn interest of up to Rs. 1,03,665. Bajaj Finance FDs are AAA rated from agencies like CRISIL and ICRA, and offer high interest rates of up to 8.65% p.a. That is why over 5 lakh depositors have trusted Bajaj Finance with deposits of over Rs. 50.000 crore.\n",
      "Disadvantages of premature withdrawal\n",
      "﻿﻿﻿Penalties: Premature withdrawal from investments can lead to financial penalties, like reduced interest rates or forfeited earnings, impacting your savings goals and overall returns.\n",
      "﻿﻿﻿Interrupted growth: Taking out money early disrupts the compounding effect, a vital factor in wealth building. Longer investments generally mean more growth, but premature withdrawal limits this potential.\n",
      "Losing interest if you withdraw and re-invest\n",
      "In some cases, you may withdraw your FD to invest in another FD offering a higher interest rate. It could be a wise decision if you profit after paying the penalty charges. If not, keeping your FD intact makes more sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "How you can avoid premature withdrawal while ensuring liquidity\n",
      "You can look at various methods as below to avoid early liquidation of fixed deposits:\n",
      "﻿﻿﻿Laddering FDs using multi-deposit facility\n",
      "You can use the multi-deposit facility with Bajaj Finance FD to split your investment amount into multiple FDs, each having a different maturity timeline and interest payout frequency. This will ensure you have a steady stream of FDs maturing in succession. Hence, whenever you need cash, you can utilise this money without going for a premature withdrawal.\n",
      "﻿﻿﻿Non-cumulative FDs\n",
      "Try to keep some FDs in the non-cumulative mode to earn a fixed payout each month. You can use this surplus money to either pay recurring expenses or to tackle emergencies.\n",
      "Sometimes even a fixed income each month helps tremendously in creating a sum in use.\n",
      "You can set your interest payout frequency as monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or annually with the Fixed Deposit interest Rate Calculator.\n",
      "﻿﻿﻿Short-tenor FDs\n",
      "If you are unsure of the time duration you might need your money, go for short FDs starting 12 months with Bajaj Finance FD. Short tenor FDs will also help you safeguard your investment against inflation.\n",
      "﻿﻿﻿Loan against FD\n",
      "Instead of breaking your FD, you can consider taking a loan against fixed deposits. This is a wise move that prevents you from depleting your finances while also ensuring enough liquidity to help you meet your emergency needs. In addition, this is a low-cost loan as you only must pay a marginal interest rate, over and above the interest you are earning.\n",
      "You can use online tools such as My Account, your online fixed deposit account, set interest payment frequency, apply for a loan against FD, and manage multiple FDs online.\n",
      "As you see, with thoughtful planning of your FD investments, you can avoid liquidating your fixed deposits before the maturity timeline. However, if you have to liquidate your fixed deposits, ensure that you're aware of the various withdrawal terms set by your lender. These terms may change periodically, so make sure you're aware of these beforehand.\n",

He wants to invest Rs. 5,00,000 in something that would not only grow his savings but help him earn a monthly income to meet his financial need.\n",
      "Use an FD calculator to check how much return he will get after investing Rs. 5,00,000 in FD for 3 years. Selecting the monthly payout option, you can find that the interest applicable on the FD is 7.81% p.a. The total interest earned would be Rs. 1,17,150 and the total maturity amount will be Rs. 6,17,150.\n",

      "\n",
      "National Savings Certificate (NSC) is a government-backed fixed-income investment scheme. This scheme encourages small and middle-class investors to invest and, at the same time, save on the income tax under section 80C. It is a saving scheme that you can easily open at any post office. Earlier, the banks and post offices used to issue physically pre-printed NSCs. But now, these are recorded electronically, or in a passbook. You can also purchase NSCs from all public sector banks and the top three private sector banks.\n",
      "However, a fixed deposit is an ideal investment option for many individuals because of its security and higher returns. FD is not dependent on market fluctuations; hence, it becomes the most reliable option for low risk and offers assured returns.\n",
      "What is a Fixed Deposit?\n",
      "A Fixed Deposit is a type of savings scheme offered by banks and financial institutions. It involves depositing a sum of money for a fixed period of time, ranging from a few days to several years. In return, the depositor earns interest on the deposited amount at a predetermined rate. The interest rate on fixed deposits is generally higher compared to regular savings accounts. The principal amount and interest earned are paid back to the depositor at the end of the fixed period. Fixed deposits are considered low-risk investments as they offer guaranteed returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "National Savings Certificates vs Fixed Deposits\n",
      "Consider the following parameters to decide which is the better investment option:\n",
      "1. Term\n",
      "National Savings Certificate demands you to invest a minimum of Rs. 1,000 for a fixed tenure of 5 years. There is no upper limit for investment, but a lock-in period of 5 years for every investment you make in NSCs. You can invest once with a lump sum amount or monthly, like a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) in NSC.\n",
      "Alternatively, fixed deposits offer flexible tenures that ranges from a minimum of 12 months to a maximum of 60 months. Just like NSC, FD also has two types of investment options.\n",
      "You can deposit a fixed sum for a specific period with Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit. Bajaj Finance also offers a Systematic Deposit Plan (SDP) which allows you to invest regularly over a specific tenure. This plan offers you to earn interest upon maturity or regular payouts.\n",
      "2. Interest rate\n",
      "You can avail a fix return of 7.7% p.a.*(as of 01/01/2024) on purchasing NSCs. NSCs have no maximum limit on investments. But there is a limit on tax-free income of up to Rs. 1,50,000 per year under section 80C. This means that interest earned on an investment over Rs. 1.5 lakh is taxable.\n",
      "While both banks and NBFCs offer fixed deposits, the bank FD offers significantly less interest, and the latter provides a much higher interest rate. Institutions like Bajaj Finance offer maximum interest of up to 8.65% p.a., which is even higher than NSCs.\n",
      "Click here to calculate your returns on FD using FD calculator.\n",
      "3. Investment security\n",
      "Security is the most crucial factor when it comes to investments. You should always ensure that your deposits are secure and give assured returns.\n",
      "This scheme guarantees complete protection of your funds and provides fixed returns just like the other option-Public Provident Fund, Bonds etc. However, the Indian Government has promoted National Savings Certificate only for Indian individual citizens. As a result, the government exempts the below mentioned from investing in NSCs:\n",
      "﻿﻿Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs)\n",
      "﻿﻿Trusts\n",

      "Is FD a Better Investment Option than Equity | Bajaj Finance\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether FD or equity is the better investment option depends on individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Fixed deposits (FDs) offer safety, stable returns, and are ideal for conservative investors seeking capital preservation. On the other hand, equities can potentially deliver higher returns over the long term, making them suitable for those willing to accept market fluctuations. Diversifying a portfolio with both FDs and equity can provide a balanced approach, combining safety and growth potential. Ultimately, the choice should align with your financial objectives, time horizon, and comfort level with risk.\n",

When looking at Fixed Deposits and equity shares, two completely different investment classes, it is important to understand that no one option is the best. However, a healthy ratio of investments in both tools can be beneficial. Usually, experts suggest investors maintain a well-diversified portfolio. It stems from the simple idea of not putting all your eggs in one basket. A balanced mix of various asset classes makes for an ideal portfolio.\n",
      "Let's try and understand both investment tools.\n",

      "Fixed Deposits (FD)\n",
      "The fixed deposit is a fixed-income instrument not affected by volatile market movements. The interest rate applicable when booking an FD is maintained throughout the chosen tenor.\n",
      "It makes it easy to estimate the returns at maturity. A perfect tool to invest in if you have certain financial goals to fulfil in a stipulated time frame. It is one of the safest investment options available to date. Here the investor need not worry about losing the capital at all. However, this low-risk avenue does not offer very lucrative returns compared to its market-linked counterparts.\n",
      "Banks, Post-offices, and Non-banking financial companies (NBCs) offer fixed deposit facilities. Since Banks and post office FDs are backed by the central government they are extremely risk-free. The NBFCs also called the company FDs, are safe provided you go through the credit ratings provided by the leading rating agencies in India. Companies like Bajaj Finance FD offer the dual advantage of higher FD rates and deposit safety.\n",

Here an investor parks his money in company-owned stocks i.e. he opts for fractional ownership in a company. In this case, if the company does well the stock does well and the investor can earn handsome returns surpassing those of fixed income instruments like the FD. However, if the company faces losses the stocks plummet, eroding your investment and it can even eat into your initial capital investment. Hence.\n",

Investors with a low-risk appetite usually prefer FD as the rates are locked-in at the time of booking the deposit and stay the same during the tenure until it matures. This makes it easier to estimate returns at maturity and decide how much to invest even before putting the money in the account.\n",
      "When investing in an FD, you have two options available cumulative and non-cumulative FD. These are based on payout frequencies. When interest is compounded each year and paid at maturity that is called cumulative FD. Alternatively, in non-cumulative FD, the interest is paid out monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annually as per your requirements.\n",

      "How is the interest earned on a Fixed Deposit Taxed? Bajaj Finance\n",
      "If you want to save for your financial objectives without taking on too much risk but receiving guaranteed returns, a fixed deposit (FD) is the way to go. Knowing what you are going to get in return is also quite simple. You only need to utilise Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit Calculator. That is why, fixed deposits are one of the most popular investment choices for most individuals who frequently earn interest on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is fixed deposit interest taxable?\n",
      "Yes, the interest earned on a fixed deposit is taxable. The interest earned is added to your income and taxed at the applicable income tax rate. It is important to note that the interest earned on a fixed deposit is taxable even if you have not made a profit on your investment. The tax on FD interest is deducted as TDS at the time of yearly interest credit. TDS is automatically levied by the bank on the interest received on your fixed deposit each year. Every year, a tax on interest earned is assessed to disperse the burden of tax payment. TDS is deducted by the issuer when interest is generated, not when interest is received.\n",
      "The income tax on interest earned on a fixed deposit is calculated as per the income tax slab of the individual. The interest earned is added to the individual's total income and taxed accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "How can you save tax on fixed deposit interest?\n",
      "One way to save tax on fixed deposit interest is by investing in tax-saving fixed deposits. These fixed deposits are eligible for tax exemptions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.\n",
      "Another way to save tax on fixed deposit interest is by investing in a fixed deposit in the name of a senior citizen. Senior citizens are eligible for a higher exemption limit on the interest earned on a fixed deposit. With Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit senior citizens can earn extra interest of 0.25% on the current FD interest rate.\n",
      "With our FD calculator, you can easily calculate the return you will get on your amount for a chosen tenure. This will help you in deciding the amount and tenure for investment.\n",
      "Opening a Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit is a smart choice since you not only earn good returns, but your investment remains safe. With our [ICRA]AAA(Stable) and CRISIL AAA/STABLE ratings, our fixed deposits becomes one of the most safest investment options in the country\n",
      ".\n",
      "Interest on fixed deposit taxable comes under which head?\n",
      "The interest earned on a fixed deposit is taxable under income from other sources and is added to the individual's total income and taxed accordingly. However, if your total income is below the taxable limit, you do not have to pay any TDS on the interest earned on a fixed deposit. Additionally, if you have submitted Form 15G or Form 15H to the bank then also you are not required to pay any TDS. The exemption limit is Rs. 50,000 for senior citizens, while it is Rs. 10,000 for others.\n",
      "Try to invest smartly to save the tax on your fixed deposit. Invest at any time of year. TDS will be disbursed in two years whether the FD amount is made at the end of the fiscal year or in the middle of the year. This may cause the interest computation for a given year to fall below Rs 10,000, in which case no TDS will be deducted.\n",
      "To save tax on the interest earned on your fixed deposit, prefer to invest in the name of a senior citizen. It is also important to understand when TDS is not reguired to be paid and how to claim a refund if TDS is wrongly deducted. Investing in a fixed deposit can be a great option for those looking for a low-risk, stable return on their investment, but it is essential to understand the taxation before investing. Open a Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit with just Rs. 15,000 and earn handsome returns on your investment.\n",
